# Image Thresholding 



## Global Thresholding

- **Description:** Global thresholding is a straightforward method where a single fixed threshold value is applied to the entire image. Pixels with intensity values above the threshold are set to a maximum value (e.g., 255 for white), and those below the threshold are set to zero (e.g., black).
- **Use Case:** Suitable when there is a clear contrast between the object and the background in the entire image.

## Adaptive Thresholding

- **Description:** Adaptive thresholding considers local neighborhoods of pixels rather than applying a single threshold to the entire image. It adapts the threshold dynamically based on the characteristics of the pixel's local environment. This helps in handling variations in illumination across the image.
- **Use Case:** Effective in scenarios where lighting conditions vary within the image, improving the segmentation of objects.

## Otsu's Thresholding

- **Description:** Otsu's method is an automatic thresholding technique that optimally selects the threshold by maximizing the variance between two classes of pixels (foreground and background). It aims to minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance.
- **Use Case:** Well-suited for images with bimodal intensity distributions, where there are clear separations between object and background intensities.

## Inverse Binary Thresholding

- **Description:** Inverse binary thresholding is similar to global thresholding, but with inverted colors. Pixels with intensity values above the threshold become black, and those below the threshold become white.
- **Use Case:** Useful when you want to highlight dark regions in the image rather than bright regions.
