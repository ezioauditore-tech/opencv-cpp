## 1. Gaussian Blur:
Think of it as if you're looking at your photo through a slightly blurry lens.
It reduces the details in the image, making it smoother and less sensitive to small variations in pixel values.

## 2. Median Filter:
Picture each pixel in your image having a group of nearby pixels. The median filter replaces each pixel with the middle value of that group.
It's like replacing each pixel with the color that is most common in its neighborhood.

## 3. Bilateral Filter:
This filter is like having a smart filter that considers not only the colors of nearby pixels but also how similar they are to the pixel being processed.
It preserves edges in the image while smoothing out areas of similar color.

## 4. Denoising Algorithms:
These algorithms are like a digital cleanup crew for your image.
They analyze patterns in the noise and intelligently remove it while trying to preserve the important details in the image.
